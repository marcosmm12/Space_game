# Space_game
Is a practice of the Web-Dev-For-Beginners's course of Microsoft. A large part of the code is exactly the same as the course one because I am still learning these languages. However, I have made some important changes: When you defeat all enemies, you have the option of lose your result and start a new game or to continue with the next level, where enemies will move faster; when you lose, you can start another game or see the results that have been made in other games; when you hit an enemy, not only the laser and the enemy are going to disappear, but also you will see a laser explosion.
